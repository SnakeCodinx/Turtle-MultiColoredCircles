# Multi-Colored Circles

This code uses the Python Turtle library to create a beautiful, mesmerizing pattern of overlapping circles in four different colors. The circles are drawn in a loop, with each iteration changing the color of the circles. The speed function is set to 0.5, which means the turtle will draw the circles at a moderate speed.
